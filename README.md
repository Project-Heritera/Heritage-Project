# Heritera - learn Louisianan Creole (and more!) in the modern day

This is a web app that is originally bespoke-made for learning Louisianan Creole (Kouri-Vini), an endangered language in Louisiana, and has been expanded for other courses as well. Users can learn from a predefined set of courses, while also being able to customize and create courses of their own, and share it to the wider Heritera community.

## About our Team

We are a team of LSU Computer Science undergraduate students, and are establishing this app as a project credit for CSC 4330 - Software Systems Development under Dr. Felipe Fronchetti (@fronchetti).
